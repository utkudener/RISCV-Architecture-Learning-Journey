# RISC-V CPU Core (Work in Progress 🚧)
This is the main directory for the RISC-V processor implementation.

### Current Status:
- [x] Initial Shell & Testbench Setup
- [x] Program Memory (loaded with 1-to-9 summation program)
- [ ] Instruction Fetch (IF) Logic
- [ ] Instruction Decode (ID)
- [ ] ALU Execution
- [ ] Register File Interface

**Note:** The `RISC-V_Core_TL_Verilog.v` file contains the base shell provided by the course, which I am actively populating with logic.
