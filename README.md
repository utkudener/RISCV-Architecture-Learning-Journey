# RISC-V Architecture Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my journey of designing a RISC-V CPU Core from scratch using **TL-Verilog** on the **Makerchip** platform. The project progresses from basic logic gates to a fully functional, pipelined RISC-V processor.

## 📂 Project Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **01_Basic_Logic_Gates** | Implementation of fundamental logic gates (AND, OR, XNOR, Full Adder). |
| **02_Calculator_Lab** | Design of a calculator with basic ALU operations (Add, Sub, Mul, Div) and Mux logic. |
| **03_Sequential_Logic** | Introduction to state and memory, including a Fibonacci Sequence generator. |
| **04_RISCV_Core** | **(Main Project)** The development of the RISC-V CPU Core shell and pipeline implementation. |

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Language:** Transaction-Level Verilog (TL-Verilog)
- **IDE/Platform:** [Makerchip.com](https://makerchip.com)
- **Architecture:** RISC-V (RV32I Base Integer Instruction Set)

## ⚖️ Acknowledgement & License
This project is based on the **"Building a RISC-V CPU Core"** course by **Steve Hoover**. The initial shell code, macro libraries, and visualization tools are provided by the course materials. 

My work focuses on implementing the logic, data path, and control signals within this provided framework.
