# Calculator Design
Before building a full CPU, I designed a calculator to understand **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** operations.
- Implements Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- Uses **Multiplexers (MUX)** to select operations based on opcode.
- Includes visualization macros for Makerchip.
