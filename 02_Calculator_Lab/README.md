# Calculator Design Lab

Before building a full CPU, I designed a calculator to understand **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** operations and Multiplexer logic.

## 🚀 Features
- **Operations:** Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- **Control:** Uses **Multiplexers (MUX)** to select operations based on a 2-bit opcode.
- **Visualization:** Integrated with Makerchip's visualization tools to see data flow.
