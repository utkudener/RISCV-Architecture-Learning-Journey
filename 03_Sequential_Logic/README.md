# Sequential Logic & Fibonacci

This section focuses on **Sequential Logic**, introducing memory elements (Flip-Flops) and feedback loops.

## 📄 Key Concepts
- **Counter:** A basic circuit that increments value on every clock cycle.
- **Fibonacci Sequence:** A generator that sums the previous two numbers, demonstrating feedback pipelines in TL-Verilog.
- **Validity:** Handling valid/invalid states in a pipeline.
